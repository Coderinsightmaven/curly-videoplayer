# VideoPlayerForMe v1.5 Expansion

Date: 2026-02-08

## Delivered in this pass

1. Preview/program workflow with explicit `Preview` and `Take` actions.
2. Transition engine for live takes (`Cut`, `Fade`, `Dip To Black`).
3. Project save/load (`.show`) for cues, transition config, output calibration, and control settings.
4. Cue metadata expansion (hotkeys, MIDI note, timecode trigger, preload flag).
5. OSC input server with actionable commands and text fallback parsing.
6. Timecode-triggered cue routing from OSC and MIDI MTC.
7. Optional MIDI backend integration via RtMidi (compile-time detection).
8. Output calibration controls with edge blend overlay and keystone filter generation.
9. Fallback slate support for output fail-safe behavior.
10. Optional NDI abstraction with compile-time SDK detection.
11. Packaging baseline via CPack for DMG (macOS) and ZIP/NSIS (Windows).

## Practical constraints

- NDI path is compile-time optional and requires vendor SDK and libraries.
- MIDI input requires RtMidi availability at build time.
- Keystone path currently uses mpv perspective filter generation (good baseline, not final projector-calibration tooling).
- Edge blend currently applies uniform border blend width per screen.

## Validation

- CMake configure/build passes on macOS (`build-default`).
- Application binary launches in smoke test run.
